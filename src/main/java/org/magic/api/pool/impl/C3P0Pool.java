By default, c3p0-spawned Threads (helper threads, java.util.Timer threads) inherit their AccessControlContext from the client Thread that provokes initialization of the pool. This can sometimes be a problem, especially in application servers that support hot redeployment of client apps. If c3p0's Threads hold a reference to an AccessControlContext from the first client that hits them, it may be impossible to garbage collect a ClassLoader associated with that client when it is undeployed in a running VM. Also, it is possible client Threads might lack sufficient permission to perform operations that c3p0 requires. Setting this to true can resolve these issues."));

This is intended to debug applications with Connection leaks, that is applications that occasionally fail to return Connections, leading to pool growth, and eventually exhaustion (when the pool hits maxPoolSize with all Connections checked-out and lost). This parameter should only be set while debugging, as capturing the stack trace will slow down every Connection check-out"));
		map.put("breakAfterAcquireFailure",MTGProperty.newBooleanProperty(FALSE, "If true, a pooled DataSource will declare itself broken and be permanently closed if a Connection cannot be obtained from the database after making acquireRetryAttempts to acquire one.

Ordinarily Connections are checked-in asynchronously so that clients avoid any overhead of testing or custom check-in logic. However, asynchronous check-in contributes to thread pool congestion, and very busy pools might find clients delayed waiting for check-ins to complete. Expanding numHelperThreads can help manage Thread pool congestion, but memory footprint and switching costs put limits on practical thread pool size. To reduce thread pool load, you can set forceSynchronousCheckins to true"));
		map.put("testConnectionOnCheckout",MTGProperty.newBooleanProperty(FALSE, "If true, an operation will be performed at every connection checkout to verify that the connection is valid. Be sure to set an efficient preferredTestQuery or automaticTestTable if you set this to true. Performing the (expensive) default Connection test on every client checkout will harm client performance. Testing Connections in checkout is the simplest and most reliable form of Connection testing, but for better performance, consider verifying connections periodically using idleConnectionTestPeriod."));

However, it does not on its own ensure that the driver used will be an instance of driverClass, as DriverManager may (in unusual cases) know of other driver classes which can handle the specified jdbcUrl. Setting this parameter to true causes c3p0 to ignore DriverManager and simply instantiate driverClass directly."));

C3P0's default policy is to rollback any uncommitted, pending work. (I think this is absolutely, undeniably the right policy, but there is no consensus among JDBC driver vendors.) Setting autoCommitOnClose to true causes uncommitted pending work to be committed, rather than rolled back on Connection close"));

This is primarily useful when applications are pooling Connections from a non-c3p0 unpooled DataSource.

If both maxStatements and maxStatementsPerConnection are zero, statement caching will not be enabled. If maxStatements is zero but maxStatementsPerConnection is a non-zero value, statement caching will be enabled, but no global limit will be enforced, only the per-connection maximum. maxStatements controls the total number of Statements cached, for all Connections. If set, it should be a fairly large number, as each pooled Connection requires its own, distinct flock of cached statements. As a guide, consider how many distinct PreparedStatements are used frequently in your application, and multiply that number by maxPoolSize to arrive at an appropriate value. Though maxStatements is the JDBC standard parameter for controlling statement caching, users may find c3p0's alternative maxStatementsPerConnection more intuitive to use",0,-1));

If both maxStatements and maxStatementsPerConnection are zero, statement caching will not be enabled. If maxStatementsPerConnection is zero but maxStatements is a non-zero value, statement caching will be enabled, and a global limit enforced, but otherwise no limit will be set on the number of cached statements for a single Connection. If set, maxStatementsPerConnection should be set to about the number distinct PreparedStatements that are used frequently in your application, plus two or three extra so infrequently statements don't force the more common cached statements to be culled. Though maxStatements is the JDBC standard parameter for controlling statement caching, users may find maxStatementsPerConnection more intuitive to use",0,-1));

If set, if an application checks out but then fails to check-in [i.e. close()] a Connection within the specified period of time, the pool will unceremoniously destroy() the Connection. This permits applications with occasional Connection leaks to survive, rather than eventually exhausting the Connection pool. And that's a shame. Zero means no timeout, applications are expected to close() their own Connections. Obviously, if a non-zero value is set, it should be to a value longer than any Connection should reasonably be checked-out.

Although closing of a Statement while the parent Connection is in use is formally within spec, some databases and/or JDBC drivers, most notably Oracle, do not handle the case well and freeze, leading to deadlocks. Setting this parameter to a positive value should eliminate the issue. This parameter should only be set if you observe that attempts by c3p0 to close() cached statements freeze (usually you'll see APPARENT DEADLOCKS in your logs). If set, this parameter should almost always be set to 1. Basically, if you need more than one Thread dedicated solely to destroying cached Statements, you should set maxStatements and/or maxStatementsPerConnection so that you don't churn through Statements so quickly.",0,-1));
